Unique Pointer
--------------

Q1. List one or two benefits of using RAII to manage memory instead manually calling `new` and `delete`.
A1. Avoid manual control. Resource can be accessed as soon as initialized.

Q2. When implementing move semantics for a `unique_ptr`, for example in the move constructor `unique_ptr(unique_ptr&& other)`, it is essential that we set the underlying pointer of the `other` parameter to `nullptr` before exiting the function. Explain in your own words what problem would arise if we did not.
A2. If we didn't set it to nullptr; The original pointer still exists, which means we can still access
data through the old pointer. It's not unique.

Q3. This method of recursive deallocation through RAII works great for small lists, but may pose a problem for longer lists. Why? Hint: what is the limit for how "deep" a recursive function's call stack can grow?
A3. Stack overflow.

Q4. What does `std::move` do in this context? Why is it safe to use `std::move` and move semantics here?
A4. std::move casts head to a r-value;
